# Color Tree

Access and modify an entity's children and its descendants through the Model Tree and Color Tree, with a familiar user interface.

## Color Tree
![Color Tree Preview](/media/colortree-preview.png)

This tool sets the colors of an entity and its descendants.

This attempts to support addons that manipulate material proxies, such as
- Hat Painter & Crit Glow Tools
- Cloak Effect Tool
- Ragdoll Colorizer
- Stik's Tools Ragdoll Color

## Model Tree
![Model Tree Preview](/media/modeltree-preview.png)

This tool sets the skin, bodygroup, or model of the entity and its descendants.

Contrary to existing solutions (Composite Bonemerge Tool "injects" the bodygroups and skins to bonemerged entity), this tool gives direct access to the bonemerged entity, allowing you to set these properties directly, with no internal changes to the entity.
